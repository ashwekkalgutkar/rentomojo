RentoMojo not just took away all our worries but in fact went to the extent of spoiling us. Where I could have owned just some bare essentials after making a huge hole in my pocket or paid unnecessary EMIs, I could smartly own a lot of stuff which would have come much later on my list. Heartfelt thanks to  the whole Rentomojo team for making our renting experience completely hassle-free."
